------------------------------------

### Overview

In this deliverable, we'll be going on a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with our trip planning, we decided to do a climate analysis about the area. we’ll use Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of our climate database. Specifically, we’ll use SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib, then we'll finish up with designing a Flask API based on the queries that we developed.

Finally, we'll finish up with designing a Flask API based on the queries that we developed earlier.
